#i.js Prelude
### The Little Synchronous Script That Could

When I was experimenting with ideas for the i.js asynchronous Javascript
library I had created this little dependency manager by stripping down
the loaders present in a couple of other large Javascript frameworks 
(Google's Closure and Dojo). 

Recently I worked on a project that could not use an async loader because of
strict limitations to http calls (think Akamai) and realized that this
incomplete vesion would be the right answer if I were to just finish it.
So that's what I'm doing.

Stay tuned for docs...
